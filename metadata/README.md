# latin_to_annotate.txt

Lists texts from the Internet Archive that have been language ID'd as being primarily written in Latin, but still await estimation of their date of composition (and confirmation that they're written in Latin).  Feel free to annotate these records and we can add their full texts to the corpus above.
